            I am a software developer aspirant. I know nowadays we have a lot of
            "crazy stuff" (tools and materials to brush up on). However, am not
            afraid. Technologies come and pass; concepts always remain with
            time.

      <h2>My Fable</h2>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          "Do you know that the average human eye blinks 20, 000 times every
          day?" what! I said. I remember it very well. I was boarding the
          USIU-Africa university Bus. It happened that I was talking to my
          friend Jimmy, who I had acquainted with a few minutes ago. We were
          sitting on the same column and row. On the bus aisle, there was a pile
          of books. Nothing special about them but one thing interested me and
          kept me engrossed---the topics: Smelling CODE, SOLID Principles, How
          to Refactor code, Simplified Algorithms, and Data structures, Clean
          Architecture by Uncle Bob, Object Oriented and Functional Programming,
          Onion Architecture, Agile Development, and more amazing topics like
          Program in Java in 21 days. The list is endless. I constantly stared
          at them until everyone could notice it. "What...?" said Jimmy. "I mean
          what...?" I said. "You are occupied bro!" said Jimmy while trying to
          get a view of the corridor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did not know Jimmy for long but I can describe Jimmy in three
          adjectives: amiable, easygoing, and likable. He did not seem like the
          other guy on the window seat. He looked undisturbed and informed
          person. I could guess his interest in reading. Regardless of our
          alternate laughs, he was reading an eye-attracting book titled: 'How
          to Jump through a Window?' He did not turn left or right (looking
          through the window). He kept smiling minute after minute. Was he a
          student? What unit is that? Finally, I guessed he was an "IT GUY". I
          had heard about how they ("IT GUYS") were so...so...so committed to
          creating uns and ins products ---that is invisible products and
          untouchable products. However, it was more likely to suppose he was
          doing a Bachelor of Science in Theft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did not still understand how code could smell? or in other words, how
          the system of rules could smell or even worse refactored or created in
          objects, among other topics. "I need to read this," I was just
          thinking over. From that moment I kept reminding myself I needed to
          explore the topics. I finally learned from my friend Jimmy that they
          were more IT books. The IT extremely motivated me more than the word
          Chinese. I heard it the first time when I was little. I once knew
          Chinese people as extra talented Kenyan people but sneeze a lot.
          Thanks, Jimmy, I know better today.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the bus pulled over and I went out.</p>
        <p>"Bye Jimmy"</p>
        <p>
          "Bye John. By the way, make your Google and Youtube your best friend"
          said Jimmy, aloud. Not caring about the surrounding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lastly broached the subject with my parents. I told them how people
          are spending 4-year college degree learning how to make code not smell
          and even testing it. He was so intrigued by the subject. I even added
          that people are doing masters for the same subject. This subject
          (making code not smell and testing it) and spending more time on it
          did not bother them. What disturbed them is that I had the same
          interest in the subject. Especially, my close mum, I recall how she
          conversed decisively and in a lowered voice, "Please son do not waste
          your time". I knew the urge by just looking at her. Nevertheless, this
          did not help. But I was glad I had my friends --Google and Youtube.
          This friend amazingly never tire of question (searches).
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I had a resourceful idea. I perceived it from Jimmy; 20,
          000 eye blinks per day. I thought it would be a good idea to create
          software that can convert those blicks into a shilling per blick.
          Sadly, someone stole the idea. I was not sad about the incident. I am
          actually waiting for the project to come to reality. I know you are
          also waiting for it.
        </p>
        <p>To end it all, I know code is never written but always rewritten.</p>
